## Why canbench 0.2.0?

[`canbench`](https://github.com/dfinity/canbench) is a benchmarking tool for Internet Computer (IC) canisters.

Version **0.2.0** introduces major improvements:

- 🧹 **Cleaner output**: optional individual streaming results, now much easier to scan
- 📊 **Concise summary**: regressions, improvements, unchanged, new benchmarks
- 🧾 **Significant changes table**: highlights top 50 performance changes
- 📥 **CSV output**: export full results to a file, also uploaded in CI
- 🔁 **New `calls` field**: tracks how many times a scope runs (useful for recursion)
- 🕒 **Commit & timestamp**: each report includes commit hash and time, so you know how fresh the data is

## Try it yourself

Clone the repo, run the benchmarks, and explore the output:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/canbench-0.2.0-demo
cd canbench-0.2.0-demo

cargo test

cargo install --version 0.2.0 --locked canbench

cd benchmarks/my_binary_heap
canbench --hide-results --show-summary --csv
```

Use `--hide-results`, `--show-summary`, and `--csv` to try out the new format.

## Tips

Always install & run with `--locked` to avoid noise from dependency updates.

If your CI compares `main` vs PR branch: expect a one-time diff when migrating from 0.1.x to 0.2.x.

## Feedback welcome

If something’s unclear or you’d like to see other examples, feel free to open an issue or discussion.

Happy benchmarking!
